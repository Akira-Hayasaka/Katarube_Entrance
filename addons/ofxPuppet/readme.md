Rigid-as-possible shape deformation in openFrameworks. A wrapper around code from [Ryan Schmidt](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~rms/software/Deform2D/index.html).

This code uses WML [wild magic library](http://www.geometrictools.com/) and OpenCV for some faster matrix operations (matrix inversion and SVD).  In the future, we'd like to remove the dependency on WML, since it's an older, modified version of the library.

If you use this addon for anything I'd love to hear about it!
